Start
Estimated Time	4H
Plan:
    I plan on starting with num_commits, then num_developers, and finally days_of_development. I chose this order
    because this is what I assumed would be the level of difficulty, starting with the easiest and finishing with
    the hardest.

    For num_commits, this is straight forward. I can simply count the number of lines that start with 'commit '.

    For num_developers, I'll count the number of different occurrences of the text after 'Author: '.

    For days_of_development I can create two Dates (using the Date class), one for the most recent date, and another
    for the date that's the farthest away. Then subtracting them will yield the amount of days in development.

Complete
Actual Time	3H 30M
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

    I had no problems with the num_commits method.

    For num_developers, I originally had the program just count the occurrences of different lines that started with
    'Author: '. However, when I tested this with the large file, I was getting 34 developers instead of 33. After doing
    some debugging, I found out that it was because I should've been counting the developers based on their email,
    instead of their name and email. One of the developers used a different name, but kept the same email, which
    caused my program to count that as an extra developer. After realizing this, I changed the method so that it would
    remove the developer's name and then solely rely on the developer's email to determine whether or not to count that
    person as a developer.

    The days_of_development method took me qutie a while to figure out, because I was making it a bit too complicated
    at first. Once I wrote it out on paper and thought it through, I was able to design a nice clean way to implement
    it.
